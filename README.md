# RustEditorKit

A modern, customizable text editor engine for Rust applications using GTK4. Built to be a powerful alternative to GtkSourceView with full Rust integration.

## Features

- **Search & replace** with pattern matching
- **Undo/redo** with complete state management
- **Internal scrolling system** with configurable policies and smooth scrolling
- **Line numbers, gutters** and visual aids
- **Cross-platform** (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- **Modular design** - use only what you need

## Why RustEditorKit?

Perfect for:
- Building Rust desktop applications with GTK4
- Replacing GtkSourceView in existing projects
- Educational projects learning text editor architecture
